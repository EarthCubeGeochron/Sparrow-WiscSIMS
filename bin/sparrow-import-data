# Description: Import `WiscSIMS` data

# This script runs on the host system and kicks off the
# import process within a docker container. It is basically temporary boilerplate.
# Eventually, we will replace this with a better way to kick off import processes.
import_pipeline="${0:h:h:r}"

# Run within container, mounting data directory
# and importer code.
### Run a docker container that does import processing
# sparrow compose run \
#   -e "SPARROW_DATA_DIR=/Data" \
#   -e "PYTHONPATH=/pipeline" \
#   -v "$SPARROW_DATA_DIR:/Data:ro" \
#   -v "$import_pipeline:/pipeline" \
#   backend \
#   python3 -m pipeline $@
echo "This is empty right now!"
